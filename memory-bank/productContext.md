# Product Context: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** July 12, 2025

## 1. Problem Statement

Creating consistently high-quality, on-brand content for social media is a time-consuming and creatively demanding task. For a brand like "Calcularte," which has a well-defined and successful voice, maintaining this consistency while generating fresh ideas is a key challenge. The manual process of brainstorming, writing, and designing visuals can be a bottleneck, limiting the frequency and quality of posts.

## 2. Product Vision

The "Calcularte Content Engine" aims to solve this problem by acting as an AI-powered creative partner. It will automate the heavy lifting of content creation, from ideation to detailed visual prompts, while ensuring every piece of output is deeply rooted in the brand's established voice. The system will empower the user to generate a high volume of on-brand content ideas and developed posts, freeing them to focus on strategy and community engagement.

## 3. User Experience Goals

*   **Simplicity:** The initial CLI should be intuitive and straightforward, with clear commands for each stage of the content creation process.
*   **Control:** The user should have full control over the generated content, with the ability to refine and edit any component (caption, image prompts) at any stage.
*   **Consistency:** The system must reliably produce content that feels authentic to the Calcularte brand, leveraging the historical data to inform its creative choices.
*   **Efficiency:** The workflow should be significantly faster than the manual process, allowing the user to move from a simple idea to a fully developed post in minutes.
