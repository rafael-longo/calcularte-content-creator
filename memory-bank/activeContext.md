# Active Context: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** July 15, 2025

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus has been on the successful implementation of the core backend and command-line interface (CLI) for the "Calcularte Content Engine." This phase involved building out the multi-agent system and integrating it for a complete post-generation workflow.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   **Flexible and Autonomous Generation Implemented (Enhancement #3):**
    *   **`OrchestratorAgent` Updated:** New methods `plan_content_ideas` and `plan_and_develop_content` were added to enable multi-step, autonomous workflows. The `generate_ideas` method was enhanced to accept strategic context from the `BrandStrategistAgent`.
    *   **`CreativeDirectorAgent` Updated:** The agent's instructions were updated to recognize and prioritize the `strategic_context` passed from the orchestrator, ensuring ideas are tightly aligned with the high-level plan.
    *   **CLI Upgraded:** Two powerful new commands were added to `src/main.py`:
        *   `plan`: Allows for flexible generation of content ideas based on a time frame or a specific number.
        *   `plan-and-develop`: Executes the entire content creation workflow autonomously, from planning to final post generation.
*   **Strategic Planner Implemented (Enhancement #1):** The `BrandStrategistAgent` can now generate proactive content plans, which are accessible via the `plan-content` command.
*   **Brand Voice Reporting Implemented (Enhancement #2):** The system can now generate a comprehensive brand voice report on demand via the `report brand-voice` command.
*   **Deepened Context Passing Implemented (Enhancement #4):**
    *   **`BrandStrategistAgent` Updated:** A new `get_specialized_context` method was added to retrieve highly focused, topic-specific examples from the vector database.
    *   **`OrchestratorAgent` Updated:** The `develop_post` workflow was enhanced. It now calls the `get_specialized_context` method to provide the `CopywriterAgent` with more relevant examples, improving the quality and consistency of generated captions.
*   **Multi-Level, Color-Coded Logging Implemented and Tested:** A custom `loguru` based tracing processor has been integrated and successfully tested. It provides detailed, color-coded logs of agent activities, tool calls, LLM generations, and handoffs, significantly enhancing observability. The `OrchestratorAgent` and `BrandStrategistAgent` have been refactored to utilize this new logging system.
*   **"LLM-as-a-Judge" Quality Loop Implemented (Enhancement #5):**
    *   **`EvaluatorAgent` Created:** A new agent was created to act as a brand guardian, reviewing content for quality and adherence to brand principles.
    *   **Generic Refinement Loop:** A generic `_evaluate_and_refine_content` method was implemented in the `OrchestratorAgent`. This reusable method creates a quality control loop that can handle both string and Pydantic model outputs, ensuring all generated content undergoes a review-and-refine cycle.
    *   **Specialist Agents Updated:** The `CopywriterAgent` and `ArtDirectorAgent` were updated to handle feedback from the `EvaluatorAgent` and revise their outputs accordingly.

## 3. Next Steps

With the first five enhancements complete, the project will now proceed to the next item on the enhancement roadmap.

1.  **Implement Enhancement #6:** The immediate next step is to implement "Persistent Session Memory" to make the CLI stateful, as detailed in:
    *   `docs/enhancement_plan_6_session_memory.md`
2.  **Continue Roadmap:** After that, continue with the final core enhancement:
    *   `docs/enhancement_plan_7_interactive_refinement.md`
3.  **Future Phase: Web Interface:** Once the core system is enhanced, a new project will be initiated for the development of the FastAPI backend and the React frontend.

## 4. Key Decisions and Considerations

*   **Orchestration via Code Confirmed:** The decision to use code-based orchestration for the `OrchestratorAgent` has proven effective for maintaining predictability and control over the complex multi-agent workflow.
*   **Structured Outputs:** Leveraging Pydantic models for structured outputs from agents (e.g., `PostIdea`, `ImagePrompt`) simplifies data handling and ensures consistency.
*   **Modular Agent Design:** The clear separation of concerns among agents facilitates development, testing, and future modifications.
*   **Generic Refinement Loop:** The implementation of a single, generic refinement method (`_evaluate_and_refine_content`) that can handle multiple content types (strings, Pydantic models) was a key decision to maintain DRY principles and create a more robust and maintainable codebase.
