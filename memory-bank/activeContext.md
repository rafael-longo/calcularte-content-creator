# Active Context: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** July 12, 2025

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is on the initial setup and planning phase of the "Calcularte Content Engine." The immediate goal is to establish the project structure, document the system specifications, and define the plan for the first phase of development, which will be the command-line interface (CLI) version of the application.

## 2. Recent Changes

*   Created the `calcularte-content-creator` GitHub repository.
*   Initialized a local Git repository.
*   Updated the `docs/System Specification: Calcularte Content Engine.md` to include references to the raw data files (`dataset_sample.jsonl` and `dataset_instagram_calcularte_profile.jsonl`).
*   Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the core documentation files:
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `activeContext.md`
    *   `progress.md`

## 3. Next Steps

The next steps will involve creating the initial project structure for the Python application and beginning the implementation of the core components.

1.  **Create Project Structure:** Set up the directory structure for the Python application, including folders for the agent logic, data ingestion scripts, and CLI.
2.  **Implement Data Ingestion:** Develop the script to load the `dataset_sample.jsonl` file, process the text, and store the embeddings in the ChromaDB vector database.
3.  **Develop Core Agents:** Begin implementing the `BrandStrategistAgent` and the `OrchestratorAgent` as the foundation of the multi-agent system.
4.  **Build Initial CLI:** Create a basic command-line interface to test the data ingestion and agent interactions.

## 4. Key Decisions and Considerations

*   **CLI First:** The decision to focus on a CLI version first allows for rapid development and testing of the core logic without the added complexity of a web frontend.
*   **Local Vector DB:** Using ChromaDB locally simplifies the initial setup and avoids the need for cloud infrastructure, making the project more self-contained.
*   **Modular Agents:** The multi-agent approach is a key architectural decision that will allow for easier expansion and maintenance of the system in the future.
