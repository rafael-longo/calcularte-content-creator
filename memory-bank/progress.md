# Progress: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** July 15, 2025

## 1. What Works

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   GitHub repository created and initialized.
    *   Local Git repository in place.
    *   Initial project documentation and memory bank created and updated.
    *   Python virtual environment (`venv-calcularte-content-creator` with Python 3.11.8) set up and activated.
    *   Core project structure established.
    *   All Python dependencies installed.
*   **System Specification:** The system specification document is up-to-date and reflects the project's goals and architecture.
*   **Data Ingestion:** The `ingest_data.py` script successfully loads data from `dataset_sample.jsonl`, generates OpenAI embeddings, and stores them in ChromaDB.
*   **Brand Strategist Agent:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` is functional and can retrieve relevant brand content from ChromaDB.
*   **Multi-Agent System (Core Logic):** All core agents are implemented:
    *   `BaseAgent`
    *   `CreativeDirectorAgent` (generates structured ideas)
    *   `CopywriterAgent` (writes captions)
    *   `ArtDirectorAgent` (generates image prompts)
    *   `ReviewerAgent` (refines content)
    *   `OrchestratorAgent` (coordinates the entire post-generation workflow).
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The `src/main.py` CLI provides commands for:
    *   `ingest`
    *   `ask-strategist`
    *   `plan-content`
    *   `report brand-voice`
    *   `plan`
    *   `plan-and-develop`
    *   `generate-ideas`
    *   `develop-post`
    *   `refine-content`
*   **Flexible and Autonomous Post Generation:** The system can now autonomously plan and develop content from start to finish using the `plan` and `plan-and-develop` commands. The `OrchestratorAgent` and `CreativeDirectorAgent` have been enhanced to support this workflow.
*   **Strategic Content Planning:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` can now generate proactive, strategic content plans based on seasonality and historical data, accessible via the `plan-content` CLI command.
*   **On-Demand Brand Voice Reporting:** The system can generate a comprehensive, human-readable report on the brand's voice, tone, and style via the `report brand-voice` CLI command.
*   **Deepened Inter-Agent Context Passing:** The `OrchestratorAgent` now provides more focused, specialized context to the `CopywriterAgent` by leveraging a new `get_specialized_context` method in the `BrandStrategistAgent`, enhancing the relevance of generated content.
*   **Multi-Level, Color-Coded Logging:** Implemented a custom `loguru` based tracing processor to provide detailed, color-coded logs of agent activities, tool calls, LLM generations, and handoffs.
*   **"LLM-as-a-Judge" Quality Loop:** Implemented an automated quality control loop using a new `EvaluatorAgent`. This loop reviews and requests self-correction on generated content before it is finalized, improving overall quality.
*   **Persistent Session Memory:** The CLI is now stateful. It uses the `SQLiteSession` from the OpenAI Agents SDK to remember conversation history across multiple commands. New `session` commands (`start`, `status`, `end`, `clear`) have been added to manage this feature.
*   **Robust Session Management:** The CLI is now significantly more robust and user-friendly. Sessions are persistent in a `sessions.db` file, start automatically, and are protected by a token limit safeguard to prevent excessive API costs. A new `session inspect` command allows for easy debugging.
*   **System-Wide Stability (`asyncio` fix):** A critical bug related to the `asyncio` event loop was identified and fixed across all agent-calling modules (`BrandStrategistAgent`, `OrchestratorAgent`), ensuring stable operation within the synchronous CLI environment.

## 2. What's Left to Build

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the remaining strategic enhancements, as outlined in the `docs/` directory.

**Enhancement Roadmap:**
8.  **Implement the Autonomous Maestro Agent:** Create a single, powerful, conversational entry point to the system (maestro command) managed by an autonomous MaestroAgent. This agent will interpret high-level user prompts and orchestrate the system's full capabilities by using specialist agents and functions as tools.
9.  **Create an Interactive CLI Refinement Loop:** Make the refinement process conversational.

After these enhancements are implemented, the project will proceed to the development of the web interface (FastAPI backend and React frontend).

## 3. Current Status

The project has successfully completed the first seven enhancements from the roadmap, including the critical "Robust Session Management" feature. The system is now significantly more stable, observable, and user-friendly, with key safeguards and debugging tools in place. The foundation for advanced conversational features is now solid.

## 4. Known Issues

There are no known issues at this time.
