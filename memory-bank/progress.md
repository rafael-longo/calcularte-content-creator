# Progress: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** July 15, 2025

## 1. What Works

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   GitHub repository created and initialized.
    *   Local Git repository in place.
    *   Initial project documentation and memory bank created and updated.
    *   Python virtual environment (`venv-calcularte-content-creator` with Python 3.11.8) set up and activated.
    *   Core project structure established.
    *   All Python dependencies installed.
*   **System Specification:** The system specification document is up-to-date and reflects the project's goals and architecture.
*   **Data Ingestion:** The `ingest_data.py` script successfully loads data from `dataset_sample.jsonl`, generates OpenAI embeddings, and stores them in ChromaDB.
*   **Brand Strategist Agent:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` is functional and can retrieve relevant brand content from ChromaDB.
*   **Multi-Agent System (Core Logic):** All core agents are implemented and used as tools by the Maestro:
    *   `CreativeDirectorAgent`
    *   `CopywriterAgent`
    *   `ArtDirectorAgent`
    *   `ReviewerAgent`
    *   `EvaluatorAgent`
    *   `SessionAnalystAgent`
    *   `BrandStrategistAgent` (via function tools)
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The `src/main.py` CLI provides commands for:
    *   `ingest`
    *   `session`
    *   `maestro`
*   **Multi-Level, Color-Coded Logging:** Implemented a custom `loguru` based tracing processor to provide detailed, color-coded logs of agent activities, tool calls, LLM generations, and handoffs.
*   **Persistent Session Memory:** The CLI is now stateful. It uses the `SQLiteSession` from the OpenAI Agents SDK to remember conversation history across multiple commands. New `session` commands (`start`, `status`, `end`, `clear`, `inspect`) have been added to manage this feature.
*   **System-Wide Stability (`asyncio` fix):** A critical bug related to the `asyncio` event loop was identified and fixed across all agent-calling modules, ensuring stable operation within the synchronous CLI environment.
*   **Autonomous Maestro Agent:** A `MaestroAgent` provides a single, conversational entry point to the system's capabilities. It uses an "Agents as Tools" architecture, orchestrating specialist agents and `FunctionTools` to fulfill high-level user prompts via the `maestro` CLI command.
*   **Enhanced Agent Instructions and Creativity (Enhancement #9):** The system's creative and strategic capabilities have been significantly upgraded. The `MaestroAgent` is now more strategic, the `CreativeDirectorAgent` more varied, the `EvaluatorAgent` more brand-aligned, and the `ArtDirectorAgent` plans visual narratives. A new "Creative Wildcard" tool has been added to inject novel ideas into the workflow.
*   **Post Retrieval Order:** The system now correctly retrieves the newest posts from the vector database. The `query_brand_voice` function now sorts posts by date when a wildcard query is used, and `get_samples_for_brand_voice_report` was refactored to use this function, ensuring that brand voice analysis is based on the most recent content.
*   **Structured Data-Passing Protocol:** The communication between the Maestro and specialist agents (Copywriter, Art Director) has been hardened. It now uses strict Pydantic models (`PostIdea`, `ArtDirectorInput`) for passing data, eliminating information loss and ensuring high-fidelity context is maintained throughout the creative workflow.

## 2. What's Left to Build

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the final strategic enhancement on the core roadmap.

**Enhancement Roadmap:**
11. **Implement Chain-of-Thought Logging via Streaming:** Make agents' internal reasoning transparent and observable.

After this enhancement is implemented, the project will proceed to the development of the web interface (FastAPI backend and React frontend).

## 3. Current Status

The project has successfully completed the first nine enhancements from the roadmap. The recent implementation of enhanced agent instructions and the "Creative Wildcard" system marks a major leap in the system's creative and strategic alignment. The system is now ready for the final core enhancement before moving to web UI development.

## 4. Known Issues

There are no known issues at this time.
