# Progress: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** July 15, 2025

## 1. What Works

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   GitHub repository created and initialized.
    *   Local Git repository in place.
    *   Initial project documentation and memory bank created and updated.
    *   Python virtual environment (`venv-calcularte-content-creator` with Python 3.11.8) set up and activated.
    *   Core project structure established.
    *   All Python dependencies installed.
*   **System Specification:** The system specification document is up-to-date and reflects the project's goals and architecture.
*   **Data Ingestion:** The `ingest_data.py` script successfully loads data from `dataset_sample.jsonl`, generates OpenAI embeddings, and stores them in ChromaDB.
*   **Brand Strategist Agent:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` is functional and can retrieve relevant brand content from ChromaDB.
*   **Multi-Agent System (Core Logic):** All core agents are implemented:
    *   `BaseAgent`
    *   `CreativeDirectorAgent` (generates structured ideas)
    *   `CopywriterAgent` (writes captions)
    *   `ArtDirectorAgent` (generates image prompts)
    *   `ReviewerAgent` (refines content)
    *   `OrchestratorAgent` (coordinates the entire post-generation workflow).
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The `src/main.py` CLI provides commands for:
    *   `ingest`
    *   `ask-strategist`
    *   `plan-content`
    *   `report brand-voice`
    *   `plan`
    *   `plan-and-develop`
    *   `generate-ideas`
    *   `develop-post`
    *   `refine-content`
*   **Flexible and Autonomous Post Generation:** The system can now autonomously plan and develop content from start to finish using the `plan` and `plan-and-develop` commands. The `OrchestratorAgent` and `CreativeDirectorAgent` have been enhanced to support this workflow.
*   **Strategic Content Planning:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` can now generate proactive, strategic content plans based on seasonality and historical data, accessible via the `plan-content` CLI command.
*   **On-Demand Brand Voice Reporting:** The system can generate a comprehensive, human-readable report on the brand's voice, tone, and style via the `report brand-voice` CLI command.
*   **Deepened Inter-Agent Context Passing:** The `OrchestratorAgent` now provides more focused, specialized context to the `CopywriterAgent` by leveraging a new `get_specialized_context` method in the `BrandStrategistAgent`, enhancing the relevance of generated content.
*   **Multi-Level, Color-Coded Logging:** Implemented a custom `loguru` based tracing processor to provide detailed, color-coded logs of agent activities, tool calls, LLM generations, and handoffs.
*   **"LLM-as-a-Judge" Quality Loop:** Implemented an automated quality control loop using a new `EvaluatorAgent`. This loop reviews and requests self-correction on generated content before it is finalized, improving overall quality.
*   **Persistent Session Memory:** The CLI is now stateful. It uses the `SQLiteSession` from the OpenAI Agents SDK to remember conversation history across multiple commands. New `session` commands (`start`, `status`, `end`, `clear`) have been added to manage this feature.

## 2. What's Left to Build

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the remaining strategic enhancements, as outlined in the `docs/` directory.

**Enhancement Roadmap:**
7.  **Create an Interactive CLI Refinement Loop:** Make the refinement process conversational.

After this enhancement is implemented, the project will proceed to the development of the web interface (FastAPI backend and React frontend).

## 3. Current Status

The project has successfully completed the first six enhancements from the roadmap: "Evolve `BrandStrategistAgent` to True Strategist", "Implement On-Demand Brand Voice Reporting", "Enable Flexible and Autonomous Post Generation", "Deepen Inter-Agent Context Passing", "Implement 'LLM-as-a-Judge' Quality Loop", and "Implement Persistent Session Memory". The system is now more robust, with improved quality control and a stateful CLI for a better user experience.

## 4. Known Issues

There are no known issues at this time.
