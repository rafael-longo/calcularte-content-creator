# Progress: Calcularte Content Engine

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** July 15, 2025

## 1. What Works

*   **Project Setup:**
    *   GitHub repository created and initialized.
    *   Local Git repository in place.
    *   Initial project documentation and memory bank created and updated.
    *   Python virtual environment (`venv-calcularte-content-creator` with Python 3.11.8) set up and activated.
    *   Core project structure established.
    *   All Python dependencies installed.
*   **System Specification:** The system specification document is up-to-date and reflects the project's goals and architecture.
*   **Data Ingestion:** The `ingest_data.py` script successfully loads data from `dataset_sample.jsonl`, generates OpenAI embeddings, and stores them in ChromaDB.
*   **Brand Strategist Agent:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` is functional and can retrieve relevant brand content from ChromaDB.
*   **Multi-Agent System (Core Logic):** All core agents are implemented:
    *   `BaseAgent`
    *   `CreativeDirectorAgent` (generates structured ideas)
    *   `CopywriterAgent` (writes captions)
    *   `ArtDirectorAgent` (generates image prompts)
    *   `ReviewerAgent` (refines content)
    *   `OrchestratorAgent` (coordinates the entire post-generation workflow).
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The `src/main.py` CLI provides commands for:
    *   `ingest`
    *   `ask-strategist`
    *   `plan-content`
    *   `generate-ideas`
    *   `develop-post`
    *   `refine-content`
*   **Strategic Content Planning:** The `BrandStrategistAgent` can now generate proactive, strategic content plans based on seasonality and historical data, accessible via the `plan-content` CLI command.

## 2. What's Left to Build

The next phase of development will focus on implementing the remaining strategic enhancements, as outlined in the `docs/` directory.

**Enhancement Roadmap:**
2.  **Implement On-Demand Brand Voice Reporting:** Enable the generation of a comprehensive brand guide.
3.  **Enable Flexible and Autonomous Post Generation:** Introduce powerful `plan` and `plan-and-develop` commands.
4.  **Deepen Inter-Agent Context Passing:** Make context passing more intelligent and specific.
5.  **Implement "LLM-as-a-Judge" Quality Loop:** Add an automated quality control step.
6.  **Implement Persistent Session Memory:** Make the CLI stateful using the SDK's `SQLiteSession`.
7.  **Create an Interactive CLI Refinement Loop:** Make the refinement process conversational.

After these enhancements are implemented, the project will proceed to the development of the web interface (FastAPI backend and React frontend).

## 3. Current Status

The project has successfully completed the first enhancement from the roadmap: "Evolve `BrandStrategistAgent` to True Strategist". The system is now capable of proactive content planning.

## 4. Known Issues

There are no known issues at this time.
