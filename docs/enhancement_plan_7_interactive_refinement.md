# Enhancement Plan 7: Create an Interactive CLI Refinement Loop

*   **Objective:** To make the content refinement process more fluid and conversational by transforming the `refine-content` command into an interactive loop that leverages the new session memory.

*   **Key System Modifications:**
    *   **`main.py` Logic:**
        *   The `refine-content` command will be significantly reworked.
        *   **Initiation:** When first run, it will function as it does now, taking the component type, original content, and user feedback. It will require an active session.
        *   **Looping:** After the `ReviewerAgent` returns the first refinement, the CLI will store the refined content in the session and then immediately prompt the user: "Are you satisfied with the refinement? (y/n) or provide new feedback:".
        *   **User Input Handling:**
            *   If the user types 'y' or 'yes', the loop terminates.
            *   If the user types 'n' or 'no', the CLI will ask for new feedback.
            *   If the user provides new feedback directly, the CLI will use that feedback to call the `ReviewerAgent` again, using the *previously refined* content as the new input.
        *   This creates a continuous, stateful conversation until the user is satisfied.
    *   **`ReviewerAgent`:**
        *   No major changes are required for the agent itself, as the looping logic is handled by the CLI in `main.py`. The agent will simply be called repeatedly with new inputs.

*   **File System Changes:**
    *   **Modified:** `src/main.py` (to implement the new interactive loop logic for the `refine-content` command).

*   **CLI Command Updates:**
    *   **Modified Command:** `refine-content`.
        *   **New Behavior:** Instead of being a one-shot command, it will now initiate an interactive, stateful refinement loop.
        *   **Requirement:** This command will now require an active session (from Enhancement #6) to function, as it needs to store the state of the content being refined between turns.
