# Implementation Roadmap: Strategic Sequence

This document outlines the strategic sequence for implementing the enhancements suggested in `Suggested_Enhancements_2025-07-15.md`. The order is chosen to ensure logical progression, with foundational features being built before the ones that depend on them.

1.  **Evolve BrandStrategistAgent from Retriever to True Strategist**
    *   **Justification:** This is the most fundamental enhancement. Upgrading the system's core "brain" from a simple retriever to a proactive planner is a prerequisite for most other strategic features.

2.  **Implement On-Demand Brand Voice Reporting**
    *   **Justification:** This feature is a direct and high-value application of the newly enhanced BrandStrategistAgent. It provides a clear deliverable and serves as an excellent test for the new strategic synthesis capabilities.

3.  **Enable Flexible and Autonomous Post Generation**
    *   **Justification:** Building on the new planning capabilities from enhancement #1, this step operationalizes the strategy by creating powerful, flexible, and autonomous end-to-end content generation workflows.

4.  **Deepen and Formalize Inter-Agent Context Passing**
    *   **Justification:** As workflows become more complex and autonomous with enhancement #3, the need for precise, intelligent context passing between agents becomes critical to ensure high-quality, consistent output.

5.  **Implement an "LLM-as-a-Judge" Quality Loop**
    *   **Justification:** This adds a crucial automated quality control layer. It is best implemented after the core autonomous flow (#3) is in place, as it will have the most impact on ensuring the quality of machine-generated content before it reaches the user.

6.  **Implement Persistent Session Memory for CLI**
    *   **Justification:** This is a major CLI usability improvement that makes the entire system feel more like a cohesive, conversational tool. It's a prerequisite for creating a truly fluid interactive refinement loop.

7.  **Create an Interactive CLI Refinement Loop**
    *   **Justification:** This enhancement builds directly on the session memory from #6. A stateful, interactive loop is only practical once the CLI can remember the context of the conversation, making this the logical final step in improving the CLI experience.
