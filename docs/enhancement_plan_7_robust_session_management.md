# **Enhancement Plan 7: Implement Robust Session Management**

* **Objective:** To make the CLI stateful, safe, and user-friendly by implementing persistent, file-based sessions that start automatically and include safeguards against excessive context length. This is a foundational requirement for all subsequent conversational features.  
* **Key System Modifications:**  
  * **Persistent SQLiteSession:**  
    * All SQLiteSession instantiations in src/main.py will be modified to use a persistent database file (e.g., sessions.db). This ensures conversation history is saved between separate CLI command executions.  
  * **Automatic Session Start:**  
    * Commands requiring a session will check for an active session. If none exists, one will be automatically created with a timestamp-based ID (e.g., auto\_session\_2025-07-16\_18-21-00). The user will be notified with a warning message.  
  * **Token Count Safeguard:**  
    * A utility function will be created using the tiktoken library to calculate the token count of a session's history.  
    * Before executing a command, the system will check this count. If it exceeds a configurable threshold (e.g., 100,000 tokens), it will use typer.confirm() to pause and ask the user for permission to proceed, warning them of potential cost and latency increases.  
* **File System Changes:**  
  * **Modified:** src/main.py (to implement all session management logic).  
  * **New File:** src/utils/token\_counter.py (to house the get\_session\_token\_count utility).  
  * **Modified:** .gitignore (to ignore sessions.db).  
* **CLI Command Updates:**  
  * No new commands are added in this step.  
  * The behavior of all existing commands that use sessions (plan, develop-post, refine-content, etc.) will be enhanced with the new automatic start and safeguard features.
